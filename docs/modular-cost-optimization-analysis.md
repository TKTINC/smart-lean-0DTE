### Intelligent Data Management

#### Smart Data Sampling
```python
class OptimizedDataManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sampling_rates = {
            'market_hours': 1,      # Full sampling during market hours
            'pre_market': 5,        # 5-minute sampling pre-market
            'after_hours': 10,      # 10-minute sampling after hours
            'weekends': 60          # Hourly sampling on weekends
        }
    
    def get_sampling_rate(self) -> int:
        """Return appropriate sampling rate based on market conditions."""
        current_time = datetime.now()
        if self.is_market_hours(current_time):
            return self.sampling_rates['market_hours']
        elif self.is_pre_market(current_time):
            return self.sampling_rates['pre_market']
        elif self.is_after_hours(current_time):
            return self.sampling_rates['after_hours']
        else:
            return self.sampling_rates['weekends']
```

#### Efficient Caching Strategy
```python
class LeanCacheManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache_ttl = {
            'real_time_prices': 30,      # 30 seconds
            'options_chains': 300,       # 5 minutes
            'correlations': 600,         # 10 minutes
            'historical_data': 3600,     # 1 hour
            'ai_predictions': 1800       # 30 minutes
        }
    
    def cache_with_compression(self, key: str, data: Any, ttl: int = None):
        """Cache data with intelligent compression."""
        compressed_data = self.compress_data(data)
        cache_ttl = ttl or self.cache_ttl.get(key.split(':')[0], 300)
        return self.redis_client.setex(key, cache_ttl, compressed_data)
```

### Consolidated AI Architecture

#### Unified AI Engine
Instead of multiple specialized AI models, implement a single, efficient ensemble model:

```python
class LeanAIEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ensemble_model = self.load_optimized_model()
        self.feature_selector = EfficientFeatureSelector()
        self.prediction_cache = {}
    
    def generate_signals(self, market_data: Dict) -> List[Signal]:
        """Generate signals using optimized AI pipeline."""
        # Efficient feature extraction
        features = self.feature_selector.extract_key_features(market_data)
        
        # Cached predictions for similar market conditions
        cache_key = self.generate_cache_key(features)
        if cache_key in self.prediction_cache:
            return self.prediction_cache[cache_key]
        
        # Single model inference
        predictions = self.ensemble_model.predict(features)
        signals = self.convert_predictions_to_signals(predictions)
        
        # Cache results
        self.prediction_cache[cache_key] = signals
        return signals
```
